# Conflict register

Phase 1 of the Almanac, Docket and command line refactor. Started 23 September 2026.

Every place the four spec files disagree with each other or with the code. The old
`refactor/` docs are background only (inventory ruling 4), so they appear here only
where the code they describe is in the way.

Each entry gives both sides, then a **suggestion**. A suggestion is not a decision.
Rule on it with the entry number, for example "C7: yes" or "C7: no, pills everywhere".

Abbreviations: **A** = `almanac-spec-decisions.md`, **D** = `docket-spec-decisions.md`,
**v30** = `parliament_almanac_v30.html`, **v12** = `parliament_docket_v12.html`.
Line numbers are approximate.

## Rulings

**Ruled 23 September 2026:**

- **C15. The network is no longer limited to Anthropic.**
  - Providers: Anthropic, Mistral and Ollama (local).
  - Sources: Wikipedia, Hacker News, OpenAlex and the Guardian Open Platform.
  - Later: offline archives such as Kiwix, served locally, as a source component scoped to localhost.
  - Open follow-ups are under C15.
- **C17. Four kinds get a number: chats, notes, highlights and dockets.**
  - These are also the four kind pills (blue chat, purple note, pink highlight, teal docket), and each is a row with an id column.
  - All four share one number space and numbers never overlap, so `open:207` knows the kind from the number alone.
  - Branches get an address, not a number: docket number plus letter (`201B`, and `201AA` past Z). Letters are never reshuffled or reissued, and I and O are skipped.
  - Branches are not rows. They are found by typing the address, and appear as rows only under a grouping mode.
  - Steps are ordinals inside their branch (step 2 of 210B). The address stops at two levels, so there is no `201B2`.
  - A run is never part of an address. It is an argument (`open:run 3`, `from:run 3`), and the card's chrome names it.
  - Running a docket creates chats, not a docket. Each chat gets its own number and carries `from 201B, run 4` in its marginalia.
  - Still open: the starting number and the digit ceiling.
- **C18 and C19. Every chat belongs to a docket.** No chat stands alone. This overrides D §3.3, which assumed standalone chats. For the migration, existing chats may become dockets of their own. How branch families map is still open.
- **C20. Favorites fold into pins.** Users can tag a pin `favorite` themselves. The message-level detail is still open.

## Part 1. Settled by precedence

These look settled under the precedence rules (newer beats older; A wins where it
speaks). They are listed so you can confirm them in one go. A single "Part 1: yes"
covers all of them.

| # | Topic | Older side | Winning side | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Status vocabulary | D §7: `ready`, `running`, `done`, `held` (rendered "waiting on") | A §6; v12 header | `ready`, `running`, `done`, `waiting`, `paused`. `held` appears nowhere in code or stored data, so no migration is needed |
| S2 | Answered-by picker | D §7: add a third group for local models | A §8; v12 divergence 4 | One flat list ordered by cost mark, no groups |
| S3 | Docket kind pill | D §7: gold `.k-dock`, "worth a look" | A §9; v30 L415 | Teal |
| S4 | `run:201B` | D §10.1; v12 (always makes a new run) | A §5.2; v12 divergence 1 | Runs in the current run if 201B has not run there, otherwise makes a new run. The Enter line says which |
| S5 | Navy rule | D §5; v30 L344; v12 L401 (only while the command line is open on a single surface) | A §7; v12 divergence 5 | Permanent on the addressed surface |
| S6 | ⌘K | v12 binds `/` only | A §1; D §5; v12 divergence 6 | ⌘K fires from anywhere, including inside fields. The docket and Symposium advertise ⌘K only; the Almanac advertises `/` and ⌘K |
| S7 | Enter line before a run | v12 names the run only | A §2; v12 divergence 2 | States what will run, in which rooms, on which models, and cost where it can be computed without a call |
| S8 | `stop:all` | v12 reaches open cards only | A §5; v12 divergence 7 | Crosses windows. The channel is C14 |
| S9 | Docket verbs not built in v12 | v12 divergence 8 | A §3, §4, §5; D §6 | Build `undo:`, `new:branch <chat id>`, `open:` with branch addresses, `pop:`, `from:`, empty-docket help |
| S10 | `run:` as a filter | Earlier Almanac versions | A §4; v30 L1654 | `run:` is only a verb. Provenance goes through `from:` |
| S11 | "The Almanac never runs anything" | v30 `launch()` toast, comments at L546, L946, L1912 | A §5; your ruling 6 | Retired. The leftovers get cleaned up when the Almanac is built |
| S12 | Room shown as a chip | v30 header L11 ("Chips ... (type, room)") | A §9 | Room is marginalia wherever it was a chip. The table's `room` column stays a column |

## Part 2. Open: the specs disagree with each other

**C1. Where room lives, across runs.**
- A §9: "Room belongs to the branch, not the step. Steps inherit it and show a room only when they override."
- D §1 and v12 DATA: a branch keeps only its letter and name across runs. The run owns "the steps, their prompts, rooms, models".
- The question: if room belongs to the branch, is it one room for the branch in every run, or a room per branch *per run* (so run 4 can move 201B to another room)?
- **Suggestion:** per branch per run, stored on the branch's entry inside the run. That keeps D §1's promise that editing in one run touches nothing else, and still satisfies A §9. Steps store a room only when they override it.

**C2. Status marks look different on the two surfaces.**
- v30 (L129-148): a 9px dot. `done` is filled ink, `running` pulses by box-shadow, `waiting` and `paused` are dashed.
- v12 (L288-305): a pill with text. `done` is an ink wash, `running` is filled ink with a pulsing inner dot, `waiting` and `paused` are dashed outlines.
- A §6's "Mark" column describes the dot. D §7's "Chip" column describes the pill.
- **Suggestion:** keep both. The vocabulary is shared; the rendering belongs to the surface (a dot in dense lists, a pill on a document line). Say so in the component, so nobody "fixes" one to match the other.

**C3. `ready` is not silent in v30.**
- A §6 and v12: `ready` is silent, with no mark.
- v30 L135-136 and L1138 draw a grey outlined dot for `ready`.
- **Suggestion:** silent everywhere. v30 is out of step with its own comment at L130.

**C4. Marginalia turns gold on card hover in v30.**
- v30 L487: `.mc:hover .marg{color:var(--p-gold-deep)}`. The v30 header also calls marginalia "gold-muted".
- v30 L69: "Gold means the live action, and nothing else". v12 marginalia never turns gold.
- **Suggestion:** follow v12. Marginalia stays ink, and hovering a button inside it goes to full ink with an underline (both files already do this).

**C5. What carries the key element (the progressive dash border).**
- v30 L546 and L714: the trigger in the collection card is "the one key element in the whole surface". The search field carries it on the middle card.
- A §5.5: "The key element is the bar", with its border left to a visual pass.
- D §8 and the v12 header: the docket has no key element, and D asks for that to be written into the border spec.
- **Suggestion:** A §5.5. The bar is the only key element on every surface, and the v30 trigger loses its dash. Until the visual pass, the bar keeps v30's static progressive dash. Tell me if you would rather decide the border now.

**C6. A popped Almanac, and whether it runs.**
- A §4: "a popped docket can run while a popped table still cannot". v30 L950: "a popped table still never executes".
- Your rulings 6 and 8: the Almanac can run, and it can be popped out from a chat and placed on any screen.
- A §4's own rule is "a popped panel carries its parent surface's rules; a popped surface carries its own". Popping the whole Almanac from a chat is popping a surface. Popping just its table from the Almanac is popping a panel.
- **Suggestion:** both run, since the Almanac runs and a panel inherits from it. The line in A §4 becomes stale. Separately: while the Almanac is popped from a chat, commands typed in the chat's bar address the chat, and the Almanac's own bar addresses the Almanac, which wears its own navy rule. Confirm.

**C7. Fan-out and pop-up blockers contradict each other.**
- A §10: "Browsers allow multiple tabs from one user gesture, which the Enter keypress is. No permission dialog."
- A §4: "pop-up blockers allow one window per click, so the Enter line may have to say *opens 1 of 3, click to place the next*".
- Chromium and Firefox allow one `window.open` per user activation, so A §4 matches how browsers behave and A §10 does not.
- **Suggestion:** a run that needs several rooms opens one tab on Enter. Further tabs open one per click, or the steps that do not need their own frame run in the background with no tab. This is a design question for the Symposium work (inventory ruling 11). Until then, `run:` in the Almanac and docket runs steps without opening tabs.

**C8. `new:branch` from a command: where is the fork point?**
- D §3: forking happens at a message (`forked from chat 251, at step 2`).
- A §4 and v30 L1490: `new:branch 207` makes "a branch from the end of" the chat.
- **Suggestion:** bare `new:branch 207` forks from the end. Forking mid-chat is done from the message itself in the Symposium, which is where you can see the message. No extra syntax.

**C9. Help panel counts.**
- A §4: no totals, except while narrowing.
- v30 L2029 comment: "Grouped, headed and counted". v30 L2063 then removes the total.
- **Suggestion:** A §4. Only the L2029 comment is stale.

**C10. `open:` uses the wrong parser in v30.**
- A §3 and v30 L915: `open:` reads addresses (`addrsIn`).
- v30 L1463: `open:` calls `idsIn`, so `open:201B` would not resolve.
- **Suggestion:** `addrsIn`, per the spec.

**C11. A halted step is called "stopped" in v30.**
- A §5 and v12: `paused`. v30 `stop:` Enter line (L1540): "a step mid-flight is marked stopped".
- **Suggestion:** `paused`.

**C12. Parking a branch: `hold:` exists only in the docket.**
- v12 has `hold:` (sets `waiting`) and `delete:`. v30 has neither, but has `archive:` and `forget:`. A §3 leaves open whether `archive:201B` and parking are one act.
- **Suggestion:** one shared verb registry, where each verb declares which surfaces and noun classes it accepts. `hold:` applies to branches wherever they are addressed, including from the Almanac. `archive:` stays a separate act, which A §3 calls the current state. `delete:` (docket: steps, branches) and `forget:` (Almanac: rows) stay separate words for different nouns, which A §4 allows ("vocabulary can vary; kind cannot").

**C13. Where the Almanac's layout is saved, and whether it "travels".**
- A §4: "a page layout travels between devices and a window arrangement does not". v30 L949: "A saved arrangement is a Lab layout, not a private Almanac setting". v30 L963 saves to `localStorage['almanac-layout']`.
- The app has no accounts or sync, so nothing travels between devices except by export.
- **Suggestion:** Almanac layouts are stored in IndexedDB with the rest of the data and included in the backup, which is how they travel. Window arrangements (`arrange:`, out of scope) are per device and not in the backup. Whether a layout is also "a Lab layout" waits for the Lab work.

## Part 3. Open: the specs against the code

**C14. Storage and cross-window signals** (you asked what the code does).
- **What the code does:**
  - All data and settings live in IndexedDB database `parliament` v5 (`src/lib/db.js`), plus a separate key store for the API key.
  - localStorage is essentially unused: one legacy key is read once and removed.
  - Tabs share IndexedDB, so they see each other's writes, but nothing tells a tab that something changed. There is no `storage` listener, BroadcastChannel or lock.
  - A schema upgrade in one tab is blocked while an older tab holds the database open, and nothing handles that today.
- **What the spec needs:**
  - A signal channel for `stop:all` (A §5).
  - Stale-tab marginalia (A §10).
  - The orphaned pop-out message on `beforeunload` (A §10).
  - Per-device storage for arrangements (out of scope).
  - A §5 names the `storage` event as the channel, and A §10 says the tabs "share localStorage".
- **Suggestion:**
  - Data stays in IndexedDB. Nothing moves to localStorage.
  - The signal channel is `BroadcastChannel('parliament')`. It is same-origin, holds nothing at rest, and reaches pop-outs and tabs alike. The `storage` event would mean writing throwaway keys into localStorage only to trigger it.
  - IndexedDB gets an `onversionchange` handler, so an old tab closes its connection and says so before a migration.
  - This is a change of mechanism, not of what the spec asks for, so it needs your yes.

**C15. Network constraint against sources and local models.**
- The CLAUDE.md hard constraints say "connections to self + `api.anthropic.com` only" and "zero network requests except to the Anthropic API". The CSP in `netlify.toml` enforces this (`connect-src 'self' https://api.anthropic.com`).
- A §8: Wikipedia and six keyless APIs as sources, and a local Llama model in the picker (which needs `http://localhost:*`).
- **Suggestion:** this is the "scope review" the constraint asks for. Widen `connect-src` to a fixed, named list: the Wikipedia REST host plus each keyless API host as it ships, one line per source manifest. Local models wait until the provider interface grows a second provider. The constraint text in CLAUDE.md changes with it (C22). Wikipedia is the first host.

**C16. Wikipedia `User-Agent`.**
- A §8: "Send a descriptive User-Agent".
- Browsers do not let page scripts set `User-Agent`. Wikimedia's documented equivalent for browser clients is the `Api-User-Agent` header.
- **Suggestion:** send `Api-User-Agent` and note the substitution in the manifest.

**C17. Numeric ids against UUIDs.**
- A §3 and v30: one flat numeric id space (`201`, `251`). The v30 address regex takes 3 to 4 digits and the mockup numbers from 201.
- Code: every record is keyed by `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- Questions:
  - (a) Which kinds get a number? Chats, notes, highlights and dockets are specced. The code also has favorites, message pins, files and documents.
  - (b) What number does counting start at?
  - (c) Is the 4-digit ceiling (9999) intended?
- **Suggestion:**
  - Add a `num` field alongside the UUID. The UUID stays the key, so nothing that references records breaks.
  - Numbers are assigned in creation order starting at 201, unless you would rather start at 1.
  - The address regex has no upper digit limit.
  - Only chats, notes, highlights and dockets get numbers. This backfill is a migration and will be shown to you before it runs (your rule 7).

**C18. Existing branches against spec branches.**
- Code (`db.js:548`): a branch is a whole copied conversation linked by `parentId`, `branchPoint` (a message id) and `familyId`. It has no letters and no docket.
- D §3: forking writes a lettered branch into a docket, and forking a standalone chat creates a docket.
- **Suggestion:**
  - Existing branch families stay as plain chats with their provenance kept in marginalia (`branched from 207`). No dockets are created retroactively.
  - Only forks made after the change follow D §3.
  - The other option is to convert each family into a docket, which is a migration you would see first. I lean against it: it invents plans after the fact.

**C19. Chats are multi-turn today; a docket step is one prompt and one answer.**
- D §3: "one step is one prompt and one answer", and typing freely in the Symposium appends a step to the current run.
- Code: a chat is an open-ended list of messages, with no notion of a run or step.
- **Suggestion:** a chat that belongs to a docket gets its steps from its turns: turn N is step N of that branch in that run. A standalone chat has no steps until it is forked (C18). This is data-model work, detailed in the change plan.

**C20. The word "pin" means two things.**
- A §3: `pin:` is an annotation (top of the list in the Almanac, marked in the docket).
- Code: the `pins` store copies a message into another chat for reference (`db.js:793`, "Pin for reference" in `messages-render.jsx`). Code also has per-conversation `pinned` (which does match A §3) and a separate `favorites` store.
- **Suggestion:** `pin:` is the conversation `pinned` flag, extended to any row. The message-copy feature keeps its data but its UI label changes to "carry to" or similar. Favorites need a ruling: fold them into pins, or keep them as a filter (`has:favorite`).

**C21. Almanac as the homepage against every surface being a room.**
- CLAUDE.md: "every chat surface now renders through `<RoomShell>` against a mode file". The Study is a homepage-scope mode file.
- Your ruling 8: the Almanac replaces the Study. The Almanac in v30 is fixed chrome with its own three-slot layout and `layout:` verbs, not a room.
- **Suggestion:**
  - The Almanac is an app surface, not a mode file, so it does not go through `RoomShell`.
  - Rooms stay mode files, and the Symposium renders rooms.
  - Homepage-scope mode files (`home_default`, "The Study") are proposed for retirement in the change plan, not deleted now.

**C22. CLAUDE.md contradicts the new direction.** The proposed rewrite is at the foot of this file. Contradictions:
- Its "where to look" table sends readers to `refactor/` as the canonical spec.
- It describes the product as rooms plus homepage (the Study, the blueprint) and names none of Almanac, Docket, Symposium or the command line.
- Its network constraint forbids sources (C15).
- It files local models under Phase 2, while A §8 puts them in the picker.
- Its "What's gone" list is about V1 and says nothing about the old V2 Phase 1 concepts now going.
- "Project Apollo" is the repo name; the product is Parliament.

**C23. The old visual system in code against the mockups.**
- Code tokens (`--p-bg-*`, `--p-text-*`, `--p-gold*`, in `src/lib/schemes.js` and `src/index.css`) and gold for selected and active states: pinned icons, sort arrows, the selected model, focus borders, the default highlight colour `#B8A070`, the "+ Build a room" button, and the backup indicator (gold, amber, red).
- Catalog type tags: room gold, layout violet, component teal, scheme orange. Motion uses Framer Motion springs.
- The mockups: bone paper `#FCFCFA`, ink `#191919`, navy for command mode, and gold for the live action only (search engaged, trigger hover, keyboard focus). The kind pill hue family is blue, purple, pink and teal. Motion is short CSS transitions.
- Your rulings 5, 9 and 10 settle direction: the mockups replace the app's chrome, and rooms keep their schemes inside.
- **Suggestion:** new chrome tokens are taken verbatim from the mockups' `:root`. Every gold use outside the live action moves to ink.
- **Open detail:** the highlight kind is pink in v30, but highlights in rooms are drawn gold today. Suggest that highlights inside a room follow the room's scheme, and the Almanac pill is pink.

**C24. Voice.**
- A §11 lists voice as Named, for V2, riding on the prompt line.
- Code: `voice-input@1.0` is Live in Pocket Chat rooms.
- **Suggestion:** leave the room component alone. The prompt-line voice is out of scope, as the brief says.

**C25. Two export paths, and the Almanac export.**
- Code: the versioned `.parliament` backup (`backup.js`, envelope `version: 1`), and an older `.apb`/JSON export still offered in Settings (`SettingsView.jsx:759`, no format field).
- v30 L1866: an Almanac export of selected rows as markdown or JSONL.
- A §10: format versioning and a migration path are owed.
- **Suggestion:**
  - The `.parliament` backup is the one restorable format. It gets per-version record migration on import before any schema change.
  - The Almanac export is a read-only content export and is not restorable.
  - The older Settings export goes on the retirement list.

**C26. Model list.**
- A §8's picker: Claude Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5, marked ×15, ×3, ×1.
- The mockups' sample data: Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6. Code: Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Opus 4.7.
- The current Anthropic lineup is Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5 and Fable 5.1.
- **Suggestion:** update the provider's model list to the current lineup when the picker is built. Cost marks are stored per model as fixed multipliers, as A §8 intends. Which models appear is your call.

## Part 4. Code issues found on the way (not spec conflicts)

- **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+B is bound twice.** It opens the branch panel (`BranchShortcutHandler.jsx:41`) and the backup modal (`BackupContext.jsx:53`) at once on chat pages.
- **A merge restore that renames a conversation leaves broken references** (`backup.js:600-730`): `branchPoint`, child `parentId`, message ids on notes, highlights and favorites, and `pins.sourceMessageId` are not remapped. This matters before any migration.
- **The older import path (`db.js` `importData`, L979) likely throws on `sbrd_documents`.** It keys on `item.id || item.key`, but those records are keyed on `conversationId`.
- **The homepage Chats section loads the API key by a different setting than the rest of the app** (`settings.persistKey` against `settings.storageMode`, `chats-preview.jsx`).

## Proposed CLAUDE.md rewrite

Not applied. Approve, amend or reject. The "Read this first" block already in the file
stays as it is.

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md: Parliament

## Read this first
(unchanged block)

## Orientation

Parliament is a client-side AI workspace. No backend, no accounts. Users bring
their own Anthropic API key; everything else lives in the browser's IndexedDB.

It is mid-refactor to a new direction, defined only by the four files in
`docs/spec/`:

- **Almanac**: the homepage. One table of everything you have made (chats,
  notes, highlights, dockets), addressed by number. Can also be opened or
  popped out from anywhere.
- **Docket**: a plan of steps across branches and runs.
- **Symposium**: the flow of chats from room to room that a docket directs.
- **The command line**: one field read three ways (search, `>` command,
  `p>` prompt). It is the actor on every surface; surfaces do not execute.

Rooms (mode files rendered by `<RoomShell>`, with their own colour schemes)
stay. The Lab (`/edit`), wizard (`/build`) and editor are redesigned in a
later step.

Working files: `docs/spec/inventory.md` (what exists), `docs/spec/conflicts.md`
(rulings), `docs/spec/change-plan.md` (the plan).

`refactor/` holds the previous refactor (V2 Phase 1). It explains how the
current code got here. It is not a source of requirements, and documents it
cites that are missing from the repo are gone.

## Hard constraints (do not relax without scope review)

- Pure client-side. No backend, no servers, no accounts.
- Strict CSP. Scripts from self only. Connections to self, `api.anthropic.com`,
  and the named source hosts listed in `netlify.toml` (one per shipped source
  manifest). No third-party scripts, analytics or tracking.
- API key encrypted at rest via Web Crypto (AES-GCM, non-extractable). Web
  Crypto only for anything cryptographic.
- Provider abstraction always. Model calls go through `src/providers/`,
  against the interface in `src/providers/base.js`.
- Stored data: never run a migration or schema change without showing it
  first. Every backup ever written must stay readable.
- Nothing is deleted without explicit approval, item by item. Prefer
  `/deprecated` or a flag.

## Conventions

- Visual values come from the mockups in `docs/spec/`. Gold means the live
  action and nothing else. Light mode only for now.
- Copy: sentence case, no em dashes.

## Going (proposed, pending approval item by item)

The Study and homepage-scope mode files, the blueprint and its Cmd/Ctrl+.
overlay, the `/chats` selector and homepage Chats section (replaced by the
Almanac). See the retirement section of `docs/spec/change-plan.md`.
